# Preprocessed data
Using the python code included in the report appendix, individual sensor files were resampled, interpolated, filled, and concatenated to form these preprocessed sets for training and validation of models in MATLAB.

### DATASET4
Dataset4 was used to develop second iteration models that were eventually used in MPC trials. The fullrow.csv file (50 Mb) is shared via dropbox.

### ALLDATA
All data includes data from August 28, 2018 to March 20, 2019. The preprocessed 1 minute and 5 second interpolations are too large (71 Mb and 838 Mb respectively) to upload, and are shared via Dropbox instead.
